# Development Progress

## 2024-01-24 - Authentication and Testing Framework
- [x] Implemented API key authentication middleware
- [x] Created test utilities for dynamic API key generation
- [x] Implemented fingerprint ownership validation
- [x] Added comprehensive test suite for auth rules
- [x] All tests passing for authentication flow
- [x] Created development guidelines and cursor rules
- [ ] Next: Implement rate limiting for API endpoints

## Issues and Solutions
### API Key Authentication in Tests
- Problem: Tests were failing due to static API keys and improper cleanup
- Solution: Implemented dynamic API key generation and proper test isolation
- Details: Modified testUtils.ts to use registerTestUserAndGetApiKey() for dynamic key generation

### Fingerprint Ownership Validation
- Problem: API endpoints weren't properly validating fingerprint ownership
- Solution: Added ownership validation in auth middleware
- Details: Each request now validates that the API key's fingerprint matches the requested fingerprint

## Current State
- Authentication system is working and well-tested
- Test framework is robust with proper isolation
- Development guidelines established
- Basic API structure in place

## Next Steps
1. Implement rate limiting
2. Add request validation middleware
3. Enhance error handling
4. Add monitoring and logging
5. Implement caching strategy
