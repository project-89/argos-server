## Focus Areas for Optimization

### 1. Database Indexing
- Create appropriate indexes for all collections
- Analyze query patterns and optimize index coverage
- Document index strategy for future maintenance

### 2. Query Optimization
- Review and optimize complex queries
- Convert any remaining Firebase-specific query patterns to MongoDB best practices
- Implement aggregation pipelines for analytics and reporting queries

### 3. Performance Testing
- Develop performance benchmarks
- Test with production-like data volumes
- Identify and address bottlenecks

## Production Preparation

### 1. Database Configuration
- Configure MongoDB Atlas settings for production
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Establish backup and restore procedures

### 2. Data Migration
- Develop scripts for migrating production data
- Create data verification tools
- Plan cutover strategy with minimal downtime

### 3. Application Changes
- Remove Firebase dependencies
- Update connection settings for production
- Implement error handling for production environment

## Timeline

### Week 1: Optimization
- Create necessary indexes
- Optimize complex queries
- Run performance tests

### Week 2: Cleanup
- Remove Firebase dependencies
- Update package.json
- Complete testing

### Week 3-4: Production Preparation
- Configure MongoDB Atlas
- Develop data migration scripts
- Set up monitoring

### Week 5: Deployment
- Execute data migration
- Perform cutover to MongoDB
- Monitor system performance

## Conclusion
The MongoDB migration is complete with all services successfully migrated. By focusing on optimization and production preparation, we can ensure a smooth transition to MongoDB in the production environment and take full advantage of its capabilities.
