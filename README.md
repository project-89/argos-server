# Argos Server

The Argos Server is an open-source API service designed to power and manage Alternate Reality Game (ARG) experiences. Built by Project89, it provides a robust backend for creating, managing, and orchestrating interactive narrative experiences that blur the line between fiction and reality.

## üéÆ Overview

Argos enables ARG creators and players to:
- Create and manage complex narrative experiences
- Track player interactions and progress
- Manage player fingerprinting and identity verification
- Orchestrate real-time game events and triggers
- Monitor and analyze player engagement
- Scale experiences from small groups to massive audiences

Built with Node.js, Express, and Firebase, and running on Google Cloud Platform, Argos provides the infrastructure needed to run sophisticated ARG experiences while maintaining player immersion and game integrity.

## üöÄ Quick Start for Contributors

Most contributors will want to focus on the API development in the `server` directory. Here's how to get started:

1. **Prerequisites**
   ```bash
   # Install Node.js 18 or higher
   node --version

   # Install Firebase CLI
   npm install -g firebase-tools

   # Login to Firebase (needed for emulators)
   firebase login
   ```

2. **Setup Project**
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/project89/argos-server.git
   cd argos-server

   # Install dependencies
   npm install

   # Copy environment template
   cp server/env/.env.development.template server/env/.env.development
   ```

3. **Run Development Environment**
   ```bash
   # Start Firebase emulators and API server
   npm run serve
   ```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5001` with Firebase emulators running locally.
